RunCMS is an open source (GPL) Portal Framework witten in PHP and using 1 mysql database. No matter what type of website you would like to run you can build it easily with RunCMS.

Our system was not written for coders but for webmasters to be easy to use and edit.

We designed it around the thinking that if your mother or your sister cant install and make a website with it, then its no different then the others out there.

If you have tried all the fat bloated CMS systems out there like Nuke and Joomla.

Best of all its completely free (as in beer) for you to use, run and hack and even make money with it for personal and commercial use.
